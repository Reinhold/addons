## Introduction:
LiveGallery, a simple and easy to use gallery addon for ElkArte, is available for purchasing here for $30. It includes the basic tools you'll need to build a library of photos on your website: albums, items (can be any type of file, not just images!), comments on said items, searches, and a page to view unseen items!

The design is responsive (I _really_ don't like that buzzword), meaning that elements on the page adapt to different screen sizes (tablets, phones).
