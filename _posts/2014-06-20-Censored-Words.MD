## Introduction:
You want to run a friendly community, without any f*#^*ing bad words appearing. The easiest way to prevent that is to use ElkArte's word censor feature, but you really don't want to spend a bunch of time filling in words that some a##h03$ may know and then some.

That's where this delightful list of profanity will give you a head start by adding censored words to your forum.  Now lets be honest here, there are more ways to curse then there are ways to speak, so this list just gives you a head start on your profanity lesson.  Its not going to stop users from sticking their long-necked Giraffe up your fluffy white bunny.

## Features:

-  Well there are none really, it just adds a list of profanity to your word censor so all those little %^&D#head's can't as easily mess up your forum.

## Installation:
{% include install_std.MD %}
